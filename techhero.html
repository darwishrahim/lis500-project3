        <p><strong>Maxine Williams</strong>, Facebook’s Global Chief Diversity Officer, is a key figure in the push for greater diversity in the tech industry. 
        She is known for her straightforwardness and strategic approach, making her a force in the diversity and inclusion space.</p>

        <p>As one of Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg’s go-to executives, Williams has played a major role in Facebook’s diversity efforts. 
        According to Facebook’s 2017 diversity update:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of women working at Facebook globally increased from <strong>33% to 35%</strong>.</li>
            <li>Women in technical roles rose from <strong>17% to 19%</strong>.</li>
            <li>Hispanic representation in the U.S. workforce increased from <strong>4% to 5%</strong>.</li>
            <li>Black representation grew from <strong>2% to 3%</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Despite these improvements, Williams believes there is still a long way to go. 
        “If you ask me when would I be satisfied, I’d be satisfied when it’s 50% [women at Facebook],” she told Glassdoor. “More, I always want more.”</p>

        <p>Her mission goes beyond just increasing numbers—she wants Facebook’s workforce to truly reflect its over <strong>two billion users worldwide</strong>.</p>
